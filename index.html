                Our mission to inspire a passion for graphic design and a willingness to create. Since the only way to learn graphic design is to do it, we provide a setting for learning by making a group dedicated to practicing graphic design. End goals include competitions (such as Skills Canada) and using graphic design to make an impact on the world.

            The second official meeting/lesson. If you still don't have the GA icon on your desktop, talk to George Utsin as soon as possible. Thanks. <br>Today's work: starting out with patterns (because copying and pasting is so 2006) <br> If there are any questions (or you found a typo), don't hesitate to ask George Utsin. Also, it'd be great if you could sign in (this is so I know how many people actually came to the meeting/logged in at home)
