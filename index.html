            The second official meeting/lesson. If you still don't have the GA icon on your desktop, talk to George Utsin as soon as possible. Thanks. <br>Today's work: starting out with patterns (because copying and pasting is so 2006) <br> If there are any questions (or you found a typo), don't hesitate to ask George Utsin. Also, it'd be great if you could sign in <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FbQedtmnA5je0YOfH0_PkVHF0hjrBcFKPbxE1I3rH2k/viewform?usp=send_form" target = "_blank">here</a> (this is so I know how many people actually came to the meeting/logged in at home)
